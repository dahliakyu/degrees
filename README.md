# Degrees

## Project brief

A programme that determines how many "degrees of separation" apart two actors are.

Data in `small` folder is a smaller subset of data in `large` folder that can be used for testing.

In each folder there are three `csv` files.

In `people.csv`, each person has a unique `id`, correspoding with their id in IMDb's data base. They also have a `name` and `birth` year.
